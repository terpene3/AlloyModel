# AlloyModel
Prediction of Metal Alloy Stability

## Goals
The goal of this project was to compare different statistical models and deep learing for predicting the stability of binary alloys where the output is a 11 dimensional stability vector corresponding to AxB1-x where x is [0,.1,...,1] and a value of 1 is stable and 0 is unstable. In particular logistic regression, random forest, and neural networks investigated for this problem.

Exploration of the dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/terpene3/AlloyModel/blob/master/data%20exploration%20and%20preprocessing.ipynb).

## Results
The results are presented in [here](https://github.com/terpene3/AlloyModel/blob/master/Writeup.ipynb).
